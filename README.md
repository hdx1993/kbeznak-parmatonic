This is for Texas A&amp;M University CSCE670 Information Retrieval Course SEO Contest

My job is to create a webpage that scores highest for the query: kbeznak parmatonic --- two terms, lower case, no quote. There are little hits for this query on either Google or Bing. Based on our discussions of search engine ranking algorithms, we know that several factors may impact a page's rank. My goal is to use this knowledge to promote your own page to the top of the list.
